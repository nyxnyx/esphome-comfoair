# ComfoAir
Port of ComfoAir protocol to ESPHome.io firmware originally by @wichers modified by @nyxnyx
to be installed as external_components.

Add to your yaml configuration the definition of `external_components`:
```
external_components:
  - source:
      type: git
      url: https://github.com/nyxnyx/esphome-comfoair
    components: [comfoair]
```
and than use it:
```
uart:
  id: uart_bus
  rx_pin: 1
  tx_pin: 3
  baud_rate: 9600

comfoair:
  name: "ComfoAir 350"

    name: "Exhaust fan speed"
  is_bypass_valve_open:
    name: "Is bypas open?"
  is_preheating:
    name: "is preheating active?"
